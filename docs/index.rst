    production ready yet.


***************
What is Viceroy
***************

Viceroy is a Python library that allows you to run Javascript tests in a
browser, using Selenium, and reports them just like normal Python unit tests.

The main goal is to streamline continuous integration of Python web projects
that would like to test their Javascript.

For now, QUnit and Jasmine are supported, but you can add support for your
preferred testing library if you want to.
